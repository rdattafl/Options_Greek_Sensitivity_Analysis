(5/1/25) - In attempting to incorporate real-world options market data into this web app, the new overall goals for this web app (i.e., an "interactive
risk diagnostics tool" for options traders and learners) are to 1) visualize how Greeks evolve under changing market conditions, and 2) analyze real-world
options chains to explore sensitivities and trade behavior

Similar config to Pairs Trading web app - sidebar config for selecting relevant parameters, tab 1 for Greeks sensitivity explorer, tab 2 for real-world option
chain analysis, tab 3 for strategy risk simulation, and tab 4 for glossary & interpretation

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(5/9/25) Recommended tooling scope:

1. Greeks Sensitivity Explorer (educational + simulation)
âœ… Inputs: S, K, Ïƒ, T, r, q, option type
âœ… Live: plot all Greeks in 3D surface and 2D plots (like Colab Part 2 & 3)
âœ… Dropdowns for which meshgrid to view: SÃ—Ïƒ, SÃ—T, ÏƒÃ—T
âœ… Mini-table to summarize current pointâ€™s Greeks

ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Build intuition; great for learners and visual traders

2. Real Options Chain Analyzer
âœ… Pull data from yfinance or Tradier (or optional upload)
âœ… Show real option chain for selected ticker & expiry
âœ… Add custom-calculated Greeks columns
âœ… Plot Greeks across strikes (e.g., Vega vs Strike, Theta vs Strike)
âœ… Overlay on theoretical surfaces as youâ€™ve done in Colab

ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Bridge theory with market data; detect skew, mispricings

3. Strategy Risk Simulator (trader-facing)
Let the user simulate a strategy like:

âœ… Long call / put
âœ… Covered call
âœ… Straddle / Strangle
âœ… Vertical spreads

Then:

âœ… Track Greeks exposure over time (line charts for Delta, Vega, etc.)
âœ… Plot total PnL surface under varying price paths or vol changes
âœ… Add heatmaps or sliders for scenario exploration (Î”S, Î”Ïƒ, Î”T)

ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Helps understand risk evolution; supports trading decisions

4. Trade Scanner & Risk Summary
Scan the real option chain for:

âœ… Most Vega-sensitive contracts
âœ… Highest Gamma at ATM
âœ… Fastest Theta decay (short expiry, ATM)

Add simple filters (e.g., volume > X, IV > Y)
Output in sortable table with visual cues (color-code risk exposure)

ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Practical trade idea generation + risk review
